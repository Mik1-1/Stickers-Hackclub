This project is a sticker pack created for Hack Club during the Flavortown event.
The goal of the project was to design a cohesive set of original stickers, taking the process from initial concept and illustration to final presentation in a portfolio website.

The pack includes:
-Stickers inspired by well-known pop culture titles (reinterpretations, not copies)
-A custom logo designed specifically for the pack
-A recurring character, Orpheus, shown in different moods and themes

Throughout the project, I focused on:
-Visual consistency across all stickers
-Character expression and personality
-Clean, reusable assets suitable for both digital use and print
-Presenting creative work in a clear and accessible way through a web portfolio
-This repository documents the entire creative and technical process, from drawing and refining the stickers to organizing and showcasing them online.
